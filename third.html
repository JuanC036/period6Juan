    <h2 id="hi">Who is Zoom?</h2>
    <p class="type">Zoom is the fastest speedster that the Flash has encountered so far. His real name is Hunter Zolomon. He is from another universe and a second Earth called Earth-2. He had crated a time remnant(or clone) of himself called Jay Garrick. He used his "clone" to give false hope to the people of Earth-2.</p>

    <p class="type">He was a convicted serial killer before he got his powers. He almost killed the Flash once. When he had disabled the Flash, he dragged him around like a ragdoll.</p>    <img src="https://49.media.tumblr.com/a18ea4ccc7d95cf0d67ff713eb17ba63/tumblr_o0pi6jBlYY1tw9r1lo1_500.gif">

    <p class="type">Nothing major happened after that until Flash went to Earth-2. When he returned, he closed the "breaches" that had connected them to Earth-2. Zoom somehow found a way back to Earth-1 and Flash beat him. Then, Zoom escaped and kidnapped Wally West. Zoom wanted Flash's speed so Flash gave it to him.</p>

    <p class="type">This is when Zoom stole the Flash's speed.</p>

    <p class="type">Zoom didn't stop there. He killed Barry's dad. Flash wanted revenge and Zoom said if he beat him in a race he would go back to Earth-2. He had actually built a machine to destroy all versions of Earth. So, Barry created a time remnant and he stopped Zoom's plan. When he created the time remnant, he had gotten Time Wraiths to follow him. The Time Wraiths killed Zoom for messing with the timeline.</p>
<div>
    <p class="type">This is when Zoom died by the Time Wraiths.</p>
