    <p>He became a CSI and works for the CCPD. One day, he was working on a case when it started to rain. He was watching the news about the particle accelerator being activated by S.T.A.R. Labs but then, the power went out. He started closing his lab. While he was closing it, the particle accelerator exploded. Everything became weightless. Then, he got stuck by LIGHTNING!</p>

    <p>After he got his powers, he was contacted by S.T.A.R Labs. The people that contacted him were:Cisco Ramon, Caitlin Snow and Harrison Wells. He decided to use his speed to help people. When he started helping, the police were trying to capture him. When a black hole opened up in Central City, Barry raced to stop it. After he closed it, the police gave him a key to the city.</p>
    <p>He has faced many "metahumns". They all tried to kill the Flash. He has even fought a giant mutant shark and a giant gorilla. But Barry discovered that Cisco had also been affected by the particle accelerator explosion. Cisco discovered he could see other universes and see past timelines. He decided to be called Vibe. He still hasn't learned a lot about his powers.
